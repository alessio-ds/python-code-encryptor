## How to use
1. Put **pyencrypt.py** in the same folder where the program you want to encrypt is located 
2. Run **pyencrypt.py**
3. It will ask the name of the program and how many recursions you'd like to do.
- 3 recursions is usually enough. I personally suggest to not try 5 or more recursions, as it takes a lot of time to both encrypt and decrypt.

## Why?
Let's be clear. 

**This doesn't prevent people from reading your source code.**

Although, it will be a good challenge for them to decrypt it, particularly if you use more than 2 or 3 recursions.
